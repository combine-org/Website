 October 9th (Friday). It will provide a schedule which takes into account all time zone around the world. Details about the video conferencing 
 system will be announced soon. <br /> </p><p>The "Computational Modeling in Biology" Network (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate the development 
 of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and related fields. COMBINE 2020 will be a workshop-style event with oral presentations 
 and breakout sessions. The four meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, as well 
 as presentations of tools using these standards. An additional day will provide tutorials. </p>
