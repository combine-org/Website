# Coordinating standards for modeling in biology

<p>The "COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork" (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community <a  href="http://co.mbine.org/Standards "> standards and formats</a>for computational models. 
  By doing so, it is expected that the federated projects will develop a set of interoperable and non-overlapping standards covering all aspects of modeling in biology. 
  The global COMBINE effort is led by the <a href="http://co.mbine.org/about#Coordination "> COMBINE Coordination Board</a>.</p> 
  
  <p>Building on the experience of mature projects, which already have stable specifications, software support, user-base and community governance, COMBINE will help foster or support fledgling efforts aimed at filling gaps or new needs. As those efforts mature, they may become part of the <a href="http://co.mbine.org/Standards#Core_COMBINE_standards "> core set of COMBINE standards</a>. </p> 
  
  <p>One of the initial activities of COMBINE is to coordinate the organization of scientific and technical <a href="http://co.mbine.org/events "> events</a> common to several standards. Those events, as others related to our field of research are <a href="http://co.mbine.org/events/calendar "> gathered in a calendar</a>.</p>
